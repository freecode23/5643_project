TODO:
compute primes.
1. redo instances 64-128-256
2. update plot_result.py to include k8s dir


Compute Primes Notes:
k8s compute primes are not running simultanoesly:
kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=sysbench-job-256 --no-headers | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c
    190 Completed
     36 ContainerCreating
      9 Pending
     21 Running
    # 1.3 Clear log file if it exists
    > "$LOGFILE"
    
So maybe worth adding overall completion (all containers) and also make comparison
