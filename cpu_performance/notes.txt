TODO:
Compute Primes:
1. Try: k8s vm-driver none (new dir)
2. Try: compute total time taken for each N instances save as total_per_instance_count.log in each folder
3. Try: Anymethod to check level of concurrency i.e. monitor how many instances executed a any single time?
4. Try: Multinode cluster.

Compute Primes Notes:
1) k8s compute primes are not running simultanoesly:
kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=sysbench-job-256 --no-headers | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c
    190 Completed
     36 ContainerCreating
      9 Pending
     21 Running

    
So maybe worth adding overall completion (all containers) and also make comparison
